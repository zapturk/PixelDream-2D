# PixelDream-2D
A 2d Game Framework built on top of MonoGame

This is my attempt at making a bare-bones game framework on top of MonoGame. 
Is it object-oriented?
- Well sort of
- Your game object will inherit from the classes of this framework

Is it an entity component system?
- Well sort of.
- Scenes will have entities that have components.

Can it do 3D?
- MonoGame can but that is not the target of this framework.
